# Read-Aloud-eBook
Example eBook that I am making for a Freelance client.

This is the code for an eBook that reads the words on the page out loud. There are plenty of free programs that turn text into eBooks but any that can add animation or audio are very expensive and out of my client's price range. The client intends to produce a children's book to entertain and help children read. My example has 3 parts. The full paragraph page, sentence by sentence, and word by word. The 3 cases are here because the client wants to have multiple voices for characters and potentially multiple audio files. This example eBook is to show the limitations of the technology and to show my client my skills.

The text and code are mostly put together except for the timing of playback in the SMIL file. I am also missing audio files and hope to add them soon.
